# ALMA

Code for ALMA, used to generate the results in https://houeland.com/houeland-phd-thesis.pdf

The code is provided as-is, in case it's of interest. Note that it can't meaningfully run since processdata.py relies on datafiles generated from training models and making predictions that are gigabytes in size and are not included in the repository at this time.
